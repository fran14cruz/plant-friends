# Plant Friends ðŸŒ±

Plant Friends is a simple React application that fetches user data from a placeholder API and displays it alongside randomly generated images. This app is styled using Tachyons, offering a clean, minimalistic design. Currently, random images are generated from [RoboHash](https://robohash.org/), but future updates will include a real plant image API to bring even more life to the application.

## API Integration
This application currently uses [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) to fetch mock user data and displays it with random images from [RoboHash](https://robohash.org/). In the future, we plan to replace RoboHash with a plant image API to align with the "Plant Friends" theme.

## Technologies Used
- React - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Tachyons - A functional CSS framework for styling
- JSONPlaceholder - Fake Online REST API for testing
- RoboHash - Generates unique placeholder images
