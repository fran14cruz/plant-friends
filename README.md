# Plant Friends ðŸŒ±

Plant Friends is a simple React application that fetches user data from a placeholder API and displays it alongside randomly generated images. This app is styled using Tachyons, offering a clean, minimalistic design. Currently, random images are generated from [RoboHash](https://robohash.org/), but future updates will include a real plant image API to bring even more life to the application.
